# GOKUL KANNAN GANESAMOORTHY — PORTFOLIO

> Make it simple, but significant.

This repository contains my **personal interactive portfolio**, built to move beyond static layouts and showcase work through **motion, sound, and engineered interactions**.

Inspired by **Formula 1 mechanics**, this site treats scrolling, cursor movement, and transitions as a system — not UI afterthoughts.

---

## ✨ CONCEPT

The goal was clear:
- No default scrolling
- No passive UI
- No lifeless sections
- Formula 1

Everything responds — like a machine in motion.

From the intro loader to the footer, every interaction is intentional.

---

## 🏁 KEY HIGHLIGHTS

### Intro Sequence
- Custom loading screen (0 → 100%)
- Name scrambling animation (A–Z, 0–9)
- Glitch-style SFX on reveal
- Ring-style sound toggle (on / off)

### F1-Inspired Interaction System
- Custom **F1 car cursor** with smoke trails
- Scroll behaves like throttle control
- **F1 tyre scroll indicator** reacting to direction
- Motion-based *vroom* SFX synced with scroll & drag
- Trails generated during scroll and drag interactions

### Smooth Scrolling
- Powered by **Lenis**
- Replaces native browser scrolling
- Inertia-based, controlled motion
- Unified scroll + animation timing

## 📁 PROJECT PHILOSOPHY

This project prioritizes:
    •	Formula 1 
	•	Interaction over decoration
	•	Motion with purpose

It’s not meant to be loud —
it’s meant to feel alive.
